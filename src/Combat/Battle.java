// main class for combat

    /*

    Attack example:
    private static Attack poison;

    Special Condition ideas:
        - opponent or self miss turn
        - take damage/heal over time
        - take more/less damage
        - do more/less damage
        - higher/lower attack miss chance
        (and any combinations)

    Attack ideas:
        - poison (void)
        - confusion (void)
        - melee (basic/default)
        - fire (solar)
        - lightning (arc)
        - lightning ball (arc)
        - lava (solar)

    Further ideas regarding attacks:
        - each attack solar/arc/void
        -
        - some sort of mechanic so that users are encouraged to use many different attacks
        - maybe make using a variety of attacks more effective than using only one
        - weaknesses to different types of attack
        - attack upgrades
        - max amount of specialConditions is 5
        - ESSENTIAL: make attacks balanced
